# python-portfolio
A portfolio of my projects I have made using python to create video games or graphics on blender.

snakeGameProgram, Brick Game, Turtle Run Program are all my own manufactured versions of games commonly found on phones.

isometric room, room1 are 3D visuals that I developed on Blender using python. The images can be viewed on the .png files of the same name next to the .blend files.
